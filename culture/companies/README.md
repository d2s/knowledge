  - [Opt-in Transparency](http://zachholman.com/posts/opt-in-transparency/)
    - _“Can you be fully open as an organization, but not force that openness upon everyone by default? Basically, I want as many people in the organization to have access to as many things as possible, but we’re all busy, and unless I want to go out of my way to dig into something, my time is respected enough not to bother me with every little detail.”_

  - [Guide: Set goals with OKRs](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/)
    - “Studies have shown that committing to a goal can help improve employee performance. But more specifically, research reveals that setting challenging and specific goals can further enhance employee engagement in attaining those goals. Google often uses _“Objectives and Key Results”_ (OKRs) to try to set ambitious goals and track progress.”



## Apple

  - [Apple Stole My Music. No, Seriously. | vellumatlanta](https://blog.vellumatlanta.com/2016/05/04/apple-stole-my-music-no-seriously/)
    - _“I had just explained to Amber that 122 GB of music files were missing from my laptop.”_
  - [Apple Sent Two Men to My House. | vellumatlanta](https://blog.vellumatlanta.com/2016/05/17/apple-sent-two-men-to-my-house-no-they-werent-assassins/)
    - _“When I signed up for Apple Music, iTunes evaluated my massive collection of Mp3s and WAV files, scanned Apple’s database for what it considered matches, then removed the original files from my internal hard drive. REMOVED them. Deleted. If Apple Music saw a file it didn’t recognize—which came up often, since I’m a freelance composer and have many music files that I created myself—it would then download it to Apple’s database, delete it from my hard drive, and serve it back to me when I wanted to listen, just like it would with my other music files it had deleted.”_
      - 1. “If Apple serves me my music, that means that when I don’t have wifi access, I can’t listen to it.”
      - 2. “What Apple considers a “match” often isn’t.”
      - 3. “Although I could click the little cloud icon next to each song title and “get it back” from Apple, their servers aren’t fast enough to make it an easy task.”
      - 4. “Should I choose to reclaim my songs via download, the files I would get back would not necessarily be the same as my original files.”
