    - _“Statoil, Scandinavia’s largest company with a turnover of 130 billion USD, stopped doing budgeting in 2005. They switched to a model in which budget decisions are made continuously as new information emerges.”_
  - [Controlling a project leads to poor results](http://www.samihonkonen.com/controlling-a-project-leads-to-poor-results/)
    - “In fact, controlling a project will decrease its chances of becoming a major success. Using control on a type B project will degrade it into type A. To maximize value we need to be creative and disruptive. We need to do things differently, possibly in an unexpected way. Exercising control will prevent this magic from ever happening.”
  - [The most destructive misunderstanding in today’s work life](http://www.samihonkonen.com/the-most-destructive-misunderstanding-in-todays-work-life/)
    - “Thinking that high utilization leads to good results is the most destructive misunderstanding still prevalent in work life.”
      - “What makes focusing on utilization so bad? It leads to multitasking, increases overhead, kills creativity, hinders problem solving, overloads and stresses employees and prevents continuous improvement.”
    - “We should focus on results, not utilization.”
      - “Instead of focusing on hard work we should focus on finding the easiest, quickest and simplest way of reaching the desired outcome.”
  - [Measures should not be targets](http://www.samihonkonen.com/measures-should-not-be-targets/)
    - “Measures are useful. Numerical targets are dangerous. And once a measure becomes a target it stops being a good measure.”
      - W. Edwards Deming: “If you give a manager a numerical target, he’ll make it even if he has to destroy the company in the process.”
  - [Responsibility is a virus](http://www.samihonkonen.com/responsibility-is-a-virus/)
    - “Trying to make someone responsible also displays an inability to distinguish between accountability and responsibility. When people are accountable, they’ll do things to avoid being punished. Accountability can be assigned. When people are responsible, they’ll do things because they feel those things are worth doing. Responsibility is always intrinsic and can not be assigned.”
  - [Starting work at our company is scary. And it should be.](http://www.samihonkonen.com/starting-work-at-our-company-is-scary-and-it-should-be/)
    - “Traditional companies create an illusion of certainty with budgets, targets, roles and responsibilities. It’s a way of protecting people from a world fraught with uncertainty. While it may be comforting, it is still an illusion. It is better to help people learn to deal with uncertainty than to create an illusion of certainty.”

    - Priority matrix
      - Urgent vs not urgent
        - “Urgent means something that needs doing right away. Anything due today or overdue is urgent. Anything that interrupts you and demands your immediate attention, like a phone call, is urgent. Long-term projects, tasks due next week, or things you'd like to do that have no due date are not urgent.”
      - Important vs not important
        - “You probably know which tasks on your list are important and which aren't, but sometimes you need to be really honest without yourself about this. Just because someone asks you to do something doesn't automatically make it important. If it's going to make a difference to your business, or a colleague is relying on you to get it done, or it's related to your health and wellbeing, count it as important. But don't fall into the trap of calling tasks important when you could stand to delegate or delete them.”

    - “Start small: Repeat a tiny habit daily
      - “Reading: One page a night”
      - “French: One lesson every morning”
      - “I did as many as I felt like, but I always did at least one.”
    - “Focus on one habit at a time”
    - “Remove barriers: Have everything you need at hand”
    - “Stack habits: Build new routines onto existing ones”
      - “Research has shown a cue to work on your new habit may be the most effective way to ensure you stick to the habit long-term. When you stack habits, you use the existing ones as cues for each new habit you want to build.”
        - “Over time you can keep stacking new habits onto your existing ones to take advantage of automatic behaviors you’re already doing.”
