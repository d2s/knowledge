## Parse alternatives

After Facebook [announced](http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/) that they are closing down Parse,
they also [released migration tools](http://blog.parse.com/announcements/introducing-parse-server-and-the-database-migration-tool/)
and [Parse Server](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server) for self-hosting APIs.
Main problem with the released server is the lack of some core features of an API platform.
Even while individual developers started deploying their own instances of Parse Server
([Deploying Parse Server on AWS](https://gist.github.com/hassy/48bae515c393e9214d3f)),
others also started to document their progress on finding alternatives.
