_“In computing, reactive programming is a programming paradigm  
oriented around data flows and the propagation of change.”_

  - _Monadic streams for reactive programming_
  - “Most.js is a toolkit for reactive programming. It helps you compose asynchronous operations on streams of values and events, e.g. WebSocket messages, DOM events, etc, and on time-varying values, e.g. the "current value" of an input, without many of the hazards of side effects and mutable shared state.”
  - “It features an ultra-high performance, low overhead architecture, APIs for easily creating event streams from existing sources, like DOM events, and a small but powerful set of operations for merging, filtering, transforming, and reducing event streams and time-varying values.”
