  - Makani was founded in 2006 by Corwin Hardham, Don Montague, and Saul Griffith to harness untapped wind resources more efficiently. At the time, Makani was also part of the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA-E), designing and testing our 20 kW energy kite prototype.
  - Over the first five years of development, and thousands of hours of field testing, the energy kite evolved from a fabric kite powering a generator on the ground to a high-performance kite with on-board power generation. In May 2013, Makani was acquired by Google and is now working within the Google [x] team to make energy kites and widespread clean energy a commercial reality.
